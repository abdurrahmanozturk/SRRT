The input files here were used to simulate all cases presented in the article. There are three basic input files; one for uniform defect generation case, one for non-uniform defect generation case, and one for radiation induced segregation case. The parameters used in input files are non-dimensionalized numbers that are calculated based on non-dimensionalized form of balance equations for point defects (check Eq. 5-6 in article). 

To run simulations for different parameters such as grain size, reaction rate constant, diffusion coefficient, production bias, etc., the values in input files can be easily modified, and then the input file needs to re-run. Make sure that non-dimensionalized values are used in input file.
