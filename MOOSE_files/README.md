The input files here were used to simulate all cases presented in the article. There are three basic input files; one for uniform defect generation case, one for non-uniform defect generation case, and radiation induced segregation case. The parameters in input files are non-dimensionalized numbers that are calculated based on non-dimensionalized form of balance equations for point defects (check Eq. 5-6 in article). 

To run simulations for different parameters such as grain size, reaction rate constant, diffusion coefficient, production bias, the values in input files can be easily modified, and the input file re-run. Make sure the values are non-dimensionalized before modifying input file.
