The input files in [MOOSE_files/input_files](https://github.com/abdurrahmanozturk/SRRT/tree/master/MOOSE_files/input_files){:target="_blank"} folder can be modified and used to simulate all cases presented in the [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmats.2021.684862/full){:target="_blank"}. There are three basic input files; one for uniform point defect generation, one for non-uniform point defect generation, and one for radiation induced segregation case. All parameters used in input files are non-dimensionalized numbers which are calculated using the non-dimensionalization scheme given in the article (check Eq. 5-6 in [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmats.2021.684862/full){:target="_blank"}). 

Before running simulations for different parameters such as grain size, reaction rate constant, diffusion coefficient, production bias, etc., make sure their non-dimensionalized values are updated in input file.
